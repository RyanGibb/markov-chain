# markov-chain

## Usage

When markov-chain.py is ran as main, e.g. 

```
python3 markov_chain.py
```

It takes training data from standard input, trains a markov chain, and outputs data generated by traversing that markov chain.

The command line arguments are for the: markov chain order (default 1) - the number of characters per event, and the number of events to generate (default -1 for infinity).

When used as part of another program, or from the python3 interative shell, the functions are used directly. E.g.

```
Python 3.7.2 (default, Jan  3 2019, 09:14:01)

## Analysis

The generated data is crude at best. There is no sensible start / finish - each are selected randomly. The chain only knows it's order number of characters back. So quotations and other punctation rarely make sense. Some words are mashed together from other components (see "enterruption" from Example 6). 

It is interesting to see how this stochastic/statistical model can be used as a makeshift AI and for rudimentary machine learning, though.

## Examples

Books (training data) was obtained from www.gutenberg.org, and had their meta data removed.

### Example 1

Pride and Prejudice. Markov chain of order 1. Generate 100 events.

Command:
```
cat pride-and-prejudice.txt | python3 markov_chain.py 1 100
```

Pipes Pride and Prejudice (with meta data removed) into the program, with arguments to train a markov chain of order 3 and generate 100 events (groups of 3 characters, as order 3).

Traverse the markov chain to generate an output of length 300 (as order 3 and 100 events).

Output:
```
he, bleromery
whed? ot
“Weacedgr.
bllye sil ay, ho rchay

pr ithise

```

### Example 2

Pride and Prejudice. Markov chain of order 2. Generate 100 events.

Output:
```

```

### Example 3

Pride and Prejudice. Markov chain of order 3. Generate 100 events.

Output:
```

“Mr. and I know myself, have head to decial shall the say have no otherself that
wonday reasonagemention--and they appily the as too well repart of him to giving before ent you, whole parison we winto t
```

### Example 4

Pride and Prejudice. Markov chain of order 6. Generate 50 events.

Output:
```

“is your mother should be better than what we
sharers of our intimacy was of consulting himself in love with her, from their respective houses; after going o
```

### Example 5

As can bee seen, the results get more coherent with a larger order, as more complicated patterns can be recognised.

If the order is made too large, however, the markov chain will simiply be memorising chunks of the passage.

Pride and Prejudice. Markov chain of order 100. Generate 1 events.

Output
```
ng to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the
```

Running:
```
cat pride-and-prejudice.txt | grep "ng to the silent contemplation of his
> successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the"
```

Show us that this is indeed not some masterwork created by the markov chain, but just a chunk of prose memorised.

### Example 6

Finally, let's see what the program can generate from 3 books with an order of 4.

Command:
```
cat pride-and-prejudice.txt frakenstein.txt a-tale-of-two-cities.txt | python3 markov_chain.py 4 1000
```

Output:
```
