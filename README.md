# markov-chain

## Usage

When markov-chain.py is ran as main, e.g. 

```
cat binary | python3 markov_chain.py 1 -1
```

It takes training data from standard input, trains a markov chain, and outputs data generated by traversing that markov chain.

The command line arguments are for the: markov chain order (default 1) - the number of bytes per event, and the number of events to generate (default -1 for infinity).

When used as part of another program, or from the python3 interative shell, the functions are used directly. E.g.

```
Python 3.7.1 (default, Nov 23 2018, 10:01:49) 
[GCC 8.2.1 20181105 (Red Hat 8.2.1-5)] on linux

>>> from markov_chain import *
>>> train(open("binary", "rb").read(), 100)
>>> generate("binary_output", 100000)
```

## Example

An mp3 audio file was obtained from freemusicarchive.org.

The markov chain was trained on a raw audio binary file obtained from this mp3.

To get the file, encoded in 16 bit stereo:
```
mpg123 *.mp3 > binary
```

To play raw audio binary files:
```
cat binary | aplay -f cd
```

## Analysis

The results from binary output were underwhelming. The markov chain is too simplistic to be able to generate anything but static without a chain size too large for my computer (with 8Gb RAM and Swap file).
